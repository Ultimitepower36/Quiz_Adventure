# Overview

This program is a text based quiz game that takes the player through three rooms with a puzzle in each
one. The goal is to get through them all to the end. The reason that I am making this program in java, is to 
learn the limits of a new language and to expand my field of projects.

# Development Environment

I used the programming language java for this project, and it seems to hold up pretty well. I used various
coding websites to teach myself and to help me understand how java as a whole worked.

- Flesh out the puzzles.
- Refine the various methods and classes for increased efficiency.
